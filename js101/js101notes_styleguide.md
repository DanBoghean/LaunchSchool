# JS101 Notes

## Style Guide

- 2 Space Characters, **Not Tabs**. (Set your editor to insert spaces when using the `Tab` key)
- Limit lines to **80** Characters
- User **camelCase** formatting for variable and function names. 
- Constructor Functions use **PascalCase**
- User **uppercase** names with **underscores** to represent const values that don't change
- When writing code with curly braces, write the opening brace on the same line as the function name or conditional expression
- Use spaces between operatores and operands
- Use semicolons to terminate each logical line of code
